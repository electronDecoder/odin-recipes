    <h3>My dad's sister gave me this recipe for killer peanut butter cookies made with shortening.</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup shortening</li>
        <li>½ cup crunchy peanut butter</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>4½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            Cream shortening, peanut butter, and both sugars in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and
            fluffy. Beat in egg until incorporated. Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl;
            gradually stir into peanut butter mixture until combined. Cover and refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll chilled dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto baking sheets. Flatten dough balls
            with a fork dipped in flour to form a crosswise pattern.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool
            completely.
        </li>
